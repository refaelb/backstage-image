## 0.5.10

### Patch Changes

- Upgraded Backstage to v1.22.0
- Improved error handling and messaging when testing policies

## 0.5.9

### Patch Changes

- Added a policy tester for checking the behavior of RBAC policies. The policy tester is designed to display simulated policy decisions for a given set of permissions, helping you ensure that the configured policy returns the expected decisions. For each [Permission](https://backstage.io/docs/permissions/concepts#permission) selected in the UI, the policy tester will output the decision that would be returned by the policy in question for a user assigned to all of the selected policy roles. If the given permission request requires certain conditions to be met, the policy tester will list exactly which conditions would be required. You can find the policy tester in the Policy page of any active, draft, or previous policy.
